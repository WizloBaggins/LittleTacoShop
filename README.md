# LittleTacoShop
This is a final project that utilizes the fundamentals of HTML (with a hint of CSS)

From a youtuber tutorial I've watched. I was told to create a website that displays 3 pages that shows the homepage, contact me, and shop hours.

Every fundamental element that was used for this project was:

Meta

Nav - Navigation Bar

Header, Main, Footer for Formatting

Table - involving rows and columns

Header Hierarchy ex) H1, H2, H3...

Form/Fieldset/Legend - does post (so, information is private)

Link

a - Anchor Tag

unordered list

figure/figcaption

img - imagine linker to photo

abbr - abbreviation tag

hr - horizontal line bar

aside - with detail and summary tags (that will hide info inside a arrow button)

strong - bold words

address - self-explanatory

section/article - to add layers within your formatting


This is what their example end result needed to look like:

But, I created a near replica of the pictures shown. I would really recommend this youtuber: https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode . He does a really good job explaining the basics.
